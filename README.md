Team : Pobbati Surendra, Tarun Pawar

# INTRODUCTION:

We created a chatbot that is easy to use and useful to most of all the different types of people like pregnant ladies, pets, etc.
We need to type our queries into the bot.The Bot will show the results related to the query. The chatbot will end its work when we type quit, Until then you can ask as many queries as possible

# PROPOSED METHOD:

Here we created a model using Tensorflow, NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit), and DNN.
First, the model will start its training from the intents that are comprised in a JSON file.JSON file most of the common queries and related tag the model can identify regarding a particular query.
JSON file has 3 parts 
Tag: related tag
Patterns: common patterns to the tag
Response: response related to tag

The model trained up to 1000 epochs and gave some good results to asked queries. We havenâ€™t deployed the model.
